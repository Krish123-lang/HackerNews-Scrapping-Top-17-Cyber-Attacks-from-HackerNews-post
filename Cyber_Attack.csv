Sophisticated DownEx Malware Campaign Targeting Central Asian Governments,"May 10, 2023",Malware / Cyber Attack,"Government organizations in Central Asia are the target of a sophisticated espionage campaign that leverages a previously undocumented strain of malware dubbed  DownEx . Bitdefender, in a  report  shared with The Hacker News, said the activity remains active, with evidence likely pointing to the involvement of Russia-based threat actors. The Romanian cybersecurity firm said it first detected the malware in a highly targeted attack aimed at foreign government institutions in Kazakhstan in late 2022. Subsequently, another attack was observed in Afghanistan. The use of a diplomat-themed lure document and the campaign's focus on data exfiltration suggests the involvement of a state-sponsored group, although the exact identity of the hacking outfit remains indeterminate at this stage. The initial intrusion vector for the campaign is suspected to be a spear-phishing email bearing a booby-trapped payload, which is a loader executable that masquerades as a Microsoft Word file.

U.S. Government Neutralizes Russia's Most Sophisticated Snake Cyber Espionage Tool,"May 10, 2023",Cyber Espionage / Cyber Attack,"The U.S. government on Tuesday announced the court-authorized disruption of a global network compromised by an advanced malware strain known as  Snake  wielded by Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB). Snake, dubbed the ""most sophisticated cyber espionage tool,"" is the handiwork of a Russian state-sponsored group called  Turla  (aka Iron Hunter, Secret Blizzard, SUMMIT, Uroburos, Venomous Bear, and Waterbug), which the U.S. government attributes to a unit within Center 16 of the FSB. The threat actor has a  track record  of heavily focusing on entities in Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and countries affiliated with NATO, with recent activity expanding its footprint to incorporate Middle Eastern nations deemed a threat to countries supported by Russia in the region. ""For nearly 20 years, this unit [...] has used versions of the Snake malware to steal sensitive documents from hundreds of computer systems in at least 50 countries, which have"

Meta Uncovers Massive Social Media Cyber Espionage Operations Across South Asia,"May 04, 2023",Social Media / Cyber Risk,"Three different threat actors leveraged hundreds of elaborate fictitious personas on Facebook and Instagram to target individuals located in South Asia as part of disparate attacks. ""Each of these APTs relied heavily on social engineering to trick people into clicking on malicious links, downloading malware or sharing personal information across the internet,"" Guy Rosen, chief information security officer at Meta,  said . ""This investment in social engineering meant that these threat actors did not have to invest as much on the malware side."" The fake accounts, in addition to using traditional lures like women looking for a romantic connection, masqueraded as recruiters, journalists, or military personnel. At least two of the  cyber espionage efforts  entailed the use of low-sophistication malware with reduced capabilities, likely in an attempt to get past  app verification checks  established by Apple and Google.  One of the groups that came under Meta's r"
Tonto Team Uses Anti-Malware File to Launch Attacks on South Korean Institutions,"Apr 28, 2023",Malware / Cyber Threat,"South Korean education, construction, diplomatic, and political institutions are at the receiving end of new attacks perpetrated by a China-aligned threat actor known as the  Tonto Team . ""Recent cases have revealed that the group is using a file related to anti-malware products to ultimately execute their malicious attacks,"" the AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC)  said  in a report published this week. Tonto Team, active since at least 2009, has a track record of targeting various sectors across Asia and Eastern Europe. Earlier this year, the group was  attributed  to an unsuccessful phishing attack on cybersecurity company Group-IB. The attack sequence discovered by ASEC starts with a Microsoft Compiled HTML Help (.CHM) file that executes a binary file to side-load a malicious DLL file (slc.dll) and launch  ReVBShell , an open source VBScript backdoor also put to use by another Chinese threat actor called  Tick . ReVBShell is subsequently leveraged to do"
Paperbug Attack: New Politically-Motivated Surveillance Campaign in Tajikistan,"Apr 27, 2023",Cyber Espionage,"A little-known Russian-speaking cyber-espionage group has been linked to a new politically-motivated surveillance campaign targeting high-ranking government officials, telecom services, and public service infrastructures in Tajikistan. The intrusion set, dubbed  Paperbug  by Swiss cybersecurity company PRODAFT, has been attributed to a threat actor known as  Nomadic Octopus  (aka DustSquad). ""The types of compromised machines range from individuals' computers to [operational technology] devices,"" PRODAFT said in a deep dive technical report shared with The Hacker News. ""These targets make operation 'Paperbug' intelligence-driven."" The ultimate motive behind the attacks is unclear at this stage, but the cybersecurity firm has raised the possibility that it could be the work of opposition forces within the country or, alternatively, an intelligence-gathering mission carried out by Russia or China. Nomadic Octopus first came to light in October 2018 w"
Kubernetes RBAC Exploited in Large-Scale Campaign for Cryptocurrency Mining,"Apr 21, 2023",Kubernetes / Cryptocurrency,"A large-scale attack campaign discovered in the wild has been exploiting Kubernetes (K8s) Role-Based Access Control ( RBAC ) to create backdoors and run cryptocurrency miners. ""The attackers also deployed DaemonSets to take over and hijack resources of the K8s clusters they attack,"" cloud security firm Aqua said in a report shared with The Hacker News. The Israeli company, which dubbed the attack  RBAC Buster , said it found 60 exposed K8s clusters that have been exploited by the threat actor behind this campaign. The attack chain commenced with the attacker gaining initial access via a misconfigured API server, followed by checking for evidence of competing miner malware on the compromised server, and then using RBAC to set up persistence. ""The attacker created a new ClusterRole with near admin-level privileges,"" the company said. ""Next, the attacker created a 'ServiceAccount', 'kube-controller' in the 'kube-system' namespace. Las"

""This Mint Sandstorm subgroup is technically and operationally mature, capable of developing bespoke tooling and quickly weaponizing N-day vulnerabilities, and has demonstrated agility in its operational focus, which appears to align with Iran's national priorities,"" the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team  said  in an analysis. Targeted entities consist of seaports, energy companies, transit systems, and a major U.S. utility and gas company. The activity is suspected to be retaliatory and in response to attacks targeting its maritime,  railway , and  gas station payment systems  that took place between May 2020 and late 2021.
